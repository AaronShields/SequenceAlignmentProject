This is the README for Group ____'s project for the sequence alignment problem


# Project Outline
1) We'll need a generation script to read the files and create the strings

2) We'll then need to create a dp algorithm that solves the sequence 
alignment problem in a reasonable time

3) finally we'll need to plot/summarize our data
